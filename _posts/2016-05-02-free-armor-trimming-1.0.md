[Free Armor trimming](https://github.com/SalvatoreTosti/free-armor-trimming) is a project more than 10 years in the making.  

During my teenage years I played, _"The world's most popular MMO"_, [Runescape](https://twitter.com/Iumbridge "fun times").
I spent hours scheming about the road to easy virtual riches, if only I could find a simple way to automate my mouse clicks. There were a few macroing options available at the time. However, all of them proved too cryptic or expensive, so I gave up and returned to picking flax.
Little did I realize, my automatic gold-generating empire of bots would be achieved.

I've returned to my teenage dreams; my project, [Free Armor trimming](https://github.com/SalvatoreTosti/free-armor-trimming) has hit 1.0. :tada:   
FAT is a simple, free click and key macroing program, capable of recording and playing mouse clicks as well as keystrokes.

A GUI is under construction, but all key functionality can be accessed from the command line interface.  
You can view the project on my  [github](https://github.com/SalvatoreTosti/free-armor-trimming).
